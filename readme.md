This project repository was created as an effort to create a more modern and responsive version of Barry's web-page.  The layouts will adjust their settings to a maximum width of 960 pixels.  For devices that are 720px wide to 960px, the display will be percentage based and will scale accordingly.  Below 720px, there will be no columns and all data will be in a single view.  This also has the benefit of making contact information look like a business card when viewed on a small enough device.

Additionally, I have also converted all of the font sizes to em units in order to ensure similar sizes across a variety of devices.

My only comment is that the content of the second header section could be trimmed down so that it's not so long when viewed on a mobile phone.  Other than that, the site should be good for any other modifications.
